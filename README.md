# How to work effectively with me

## Why this is needed

More often than not, I find that arguments are a result of miscommunication.
This is a guide on how I like to work, my expections from you, a person who would like to work with me.
Following these guidelines will allow you to get more from me, and we will have extra time to do fun things.

## Communication

Some things work better in text, some in voice, some in person, and some in other mediums.
Figure out the right medium to convey your message.
As a rule of thumb:

Application specific tools (Github for code, Asana for tasks, GoogleSheets for numbers) are best.
If not applicable, then general structured data: Json, Yaml, CSV.
If not applicable, structured documents using Word, GoogleDocs, etc.
If not applicable, unstructured documents using Word, GoogleDocs, etc.
If not applicable, use a searchable archivable solution like Slack, Email.
If not applicable, use a streaming message solution like Whatsapp, Text.
If not applicable, use a Planned meeting.
If urgent, ask for an unplanned meeting.
If you must, call using voice or video.

If you just want to have a beer with me and BBQ, we can do that too, but that is not work.

## Meetings

Meetings are for synchronous communications which costly, inaccurate, unsearchable and overall inefficient.
[Jeff Bezos](https://www.thinkbusiness.ie/articles/jeff-bezos-rules-productive-meetings-amazon/), a smarted man than I am, figured it out.
The gist is:
Plan what you want to discuss in advance, be up front about it, and have meeting agenda.

## Research independently before you ask me

"Hi Gil, how do I do X?"
Try Google\StackOverflow\etc first, then ask me.
